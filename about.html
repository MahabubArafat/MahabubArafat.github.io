                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>I'm <strong>Mahabub Alam Arafat</strong>, a passionate Software Engineer with over 2 years of hands-on production experience. Currently working at <strong>ShareTrip</strong>, Bangladesh's leading travel technology company, where I've been instrumental in transforming legacy systems and building scalable microservices that serve millions of users.</p>

                <p>What sets me apart is my ability to take complex problems and break them down into elegant, maintainable solutions. I don't just write code‚ÄîI architect systems that can scale, perform, and evolve with business needs.</p>

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>My path into software engineering is unconventional but purposeful. I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), but my passion for technology and problem-solving led me to pursue software development through self-learning and practical projects.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>üéØ Self-Taught Excellence</h3>
                    <p>I believe in learning by doing. Every skill I've acquired, from NestJS to microservices architecture, came from diving deep into real-world problems and building solutions that matter. This approach has given me a unique perspective on software development‚ÄîI understand not just the "how" but the "why" behind every technical decision.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p>At ShareTrip, I've been involved in some of the most critical system transformations:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>API Performance Revolution:</strong> Rewrote the legacy booking API using NestJS and TypeScript, reducing response times from 20-30 seconds to 8-9 seconds (3-4x improvement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Microservices Architecture:</strong> Led the transformation of a monolithic flight booking system into three specialized microservices, reducing API calls by 60% and database operations by 80%</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Built a centralized cron job microservice that eliminated wasteful operations and reduced AWS costs by 30%</li>
                    <li><strong>Production Problem Solving:</strong> Created a custom memory-tracking package that solved a company-wide memory leak issue affecting all API traffic</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Automation:</strong> Developed an AI-enhanced visa automation bot that cut manual processing time by 80% for select countries</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Technical Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I believe in writing code that tells a story. Every function, every class, every microservice should have a clear purpose and be maintainable by the next developer who touches it. My approach combines:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance First:</strong> Every line of code is written with performance implications in mind</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability by Design:</strong> Systems should grow gracefully with business needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> The best solutions come from diverse perspectives working together</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Technology evolves rapidly, and so should we</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Code should solve actual problems and create value</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
                <p>When I'm not architecting microservices or optimizing APIs, I'm sharing my knowledge through technical writing. My blog features real-world stories from production environments‚Äîthe challenges, the solutions, and the lessons learned. I believe in transparent knowledge sharing because the best way to grow is to help others grow too.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>üöÄ Always Learning</h3>
                    <p>Currently exploring advanced cloud architectures, AI/ML integration in backend systems, and emerging technologies that can solve tomorrow's problems today. I'm particularly interested in how AI can enhance developer productivity and system reliability.</p>
                </div>
