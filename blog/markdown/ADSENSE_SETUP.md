## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Cookie Consent Integration
The cookie consent system will:
- Show banner to all new visitors
- Only load AdSense if user consents to advertising cookies
- Respect user preferences (GDPR compliant)
- Allow users to change preferences anytime

### Performance Impact
- AdSense code loads asynchronously (won't slow down site)
- Cookie consent adds ~10KB to page size
- Privacy policy is a separate page (doesn't affect main site speed)

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you need help with the setup:
1. Check [Google AdSense Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/)
2. Review the privacy policy for any needed customizations
3. Test cookie consent banner on different devices
