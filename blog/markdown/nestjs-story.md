# How I Cut API Response Time by 25% with NestJS

**TL;DR:** I rewrote ShareTrip's legacy booking API with NestJS and TypeScript. Result? 25% faster response times and way less headaches. Here's how I did it and what I learned.

## The Problem: Our API Was Slow (And Getting Slower)

Picture this: You're booking a flight, you hit "Search," and... you wait. And wait. Our legacy booking API was taking 2-3 seconds to respond on good days. During peak hours? Sometimes 5+ seconds.

The old system was a mess of:
- JavaScript spaghetti code with no type safety
- Database queries that would make your DBA cry
- Zero caching (because "we'll add that later")
- Error handling that basically said "Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"

> **The Wake-Up Call:** During a flash sale, our API response times hit 8+ seconds. Users were abandoning bookings, and we were losing real money.

## Why I Chose NestJS (Spoiler: It Wasn't Just Hype)

Everyone was talking about NestJS, but I needed more than hype. Here's what sold me:

### TypeScript Out of the Box
No more `Cannot read property 'id' of undefined` at 2 AM. TypeScript caught so many bugs before they hit production that I actually started sleeping better.

### Structure That Makes Sense
The old codebase? Finding anything took 20 minutes. NestJS forced us into a clean structure:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ booking/          # Everything booking-related
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ booking.controller.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ booking.service.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ booking.module.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ payment/          # Payment stuff here
â””â”€â”€ shared/           # Common utilities
```

## The Migration: What Actually Happened

### Week 1-2: Setting Up the Foundation
I started with the booking module. Basic CRUD operations, proper validation, and error handling that doesn't just throw generic 500 errors.

```javascript
// Before: Pray this works
app.post('/booking', (req, res) => {
  // Hope req.body has what we need
  const booking = createBooking(req.body);
  res.json(booking);
});

// After: Know this works
@Post()
async createBooking(@Body() createBookingDto: CreateBookingDto) {
  return this.bookingService.create(createBookingDto);
}
```

### Week 3-4: The Database Nightmare
Our old queries were... creative. I found a query that was doing 12 separate database calls to get data that could be fetched in one.

### Week 5-6: Adding the Magic (Caching)
This is where things got interesting. I added Redis caching for frequently accessed data:

```javascript
async getPopularFlights() {
  const cacheKey = 'popular-flights';
  
  // Check cache first
  const cached = await this.redis.get(cacheKey);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
  
  // If not cached, fetch from DB
  const flights = await this.flightService.getPopular();
  
  // Cache for 10 minutes
  await this.redis.setex(cacheKey, 600, JSON.stringify(flights));
  
  return flights;
}
```

## The Results (The Good Stuff)

**ðŸš€ Performance Improvements:**
- Average response time: 2.1s â†’ 1.6s (25% improvement)
- Peak hour performance: 5.2s â†’ 2.8s (46% improvement)
- Database queries reduced by 60%
- Zero downtime during migration

### But Wait, There's More
- **Bug reports dropped by 40%** - TypeScript caught issues before users did
- **New feature development got 2x faster** - Clean architecture pays off
- **Team happiness increased** - No more debugging mysterious crashes at 3 AM

## What I Wish I Knew Before Starting

### Start Small, Think Big
I wanted to rewrite everything at once. Bad idea. Start with one module, get it right, then expand. Your future self will thank you.

### Caching Is Your Friend (But Don't Go Crazy)
Cache the right things. User sessions? Yes. The current time? Probably not. I learned this the hard way when our "current promotions" were showing last week's deals.

## The Unexpected Bonus

The best part wasn't the performance improvement. It was coming to work and not being afraid of the codebase. When new requirements came in, instead of thinking "Oh no, how do I hack this in?" I thought "Cool, where does this fit in our architecture?"

## Should You Do This Too?

If you're dealing with:
- Slow APIs that are getting slower
- Code that nobody wants to touch
- Bugs that keep coming back
- Database queries that make you question your life choices

Then yes, consider NestJS. But remember:
- Start small and prove the concept
- Get your team on board (TypeScript has a learning curve)
- Plan for migration time - it's not a weekend project
- Measure everything so you can prove the improvements

## What's Next?

Now that our booking API is solid, I'm working on the payment system. Same approach: NestJS, TypeScript, proper caching, and actual error handling. The goal? Cut payment processing time in half.

I'll write about that journey too - including the mistakes I'm definitely going to make along the way.
